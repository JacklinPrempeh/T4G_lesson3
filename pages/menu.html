        <h3>INGREDIENTS FOR MANGO COCONUT ICE CREAM</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Full Canned Coconut Milk: I suggest utilizing canned full-fat coconut milk or coconut cream as an alternative to full canned coconut milk.</li>
      <li> Mangoes: Fresh or frozen mango can both be used. Freezing fresh mango may take longer, but it will result in a sweeter taste. On the other hand, frozen mango will create a thicker consistency, resembling ice cream from the start.</li>
      <li>Vanilla extract: just a drop for added flavour.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>1 cup coconut milk.</li>
   <li>2 tbsp maple syrup(optional).</li>
   <li> 4 cups frozen mango chunks.</li>
   <li> Â¼ teaspoon vanilla extract.</li>
   <li>Cinammon (optional).</li>
   <li>4 ice cream cones</li>
  </ul>

<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Combine the coconut milk and vanilla in a high-powered blender or food processor. Blend on low for 2 to 3 seconds to mix.</li>
    <li>Add the mango chunks into the mixture and blend at a moderate speed for 20 to 30 seconds, or until the ingredients are no longer being caught by the blades. If possible, use a tamper to assist in pushing the mango down while blending. Remember to scrape the sides and blend further until a smooth and creamy texture is achieved</li>
    <li>If you prefer to have the dish right away, you can serve it in a bowl. Alternatively, if you would like to enjoy it in an ice cream cone, transfer the mixture to a freezer-safe container and let it freeze for 30 minutes to set.</li>
